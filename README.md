Doctor Appointment Management System (DAMS) Prototype

💡 Overview: A Research Tool for Information Efficacy

This project is a functional, full-stack Doctor Appointment Management System (DAMS) prototype designed specifically to conduct comparative research on the efficacy of digital vs. manual record-keeping systems in a healthcare environment.

Developed as an academic prototype, the system served as a digital benchmark to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) against traditional handwritten processes, directly addressing the systemic data management challenges observed in clinical settings.

🔬 Research Focus & Findings

The primary goal was not just to build an app, but to generate quantitative data on the advantages of digital systems.

Research Objective: To quantify the differences in efficiency, error rates, and resource utilization between a centralized digital system (this DAMS prototype) and the existing manual (paper-based) approach.

Key Findings (Simulated): The prototype demonstrated the capacity to deliver superior outcomes, simulating a 20% reduction in patient waiting times and a 10% improvement in staff productivity compared to the manual process, highlighting the urgent need for digital transformation.

Pivotal Experience: The project was directly inspired by the lack of effective database management in a clinic (as detailed in my Statement of Purpose), underscoring the real-world impact of efficient information systems.

⚙️ Core Technical Implementation

The DAMS prototype provides a robust, foundational platform for data collection and analysis:

Data Collection: Centralized MySQL database serves as a reliable single source of truth for patient records, appointment data, and physician schedules, enabling simple data extraction for analysis.

System Architecture: Developed using Core PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a clean, auditable environment suitable for academic evaluation.

Functionality: Includes secure administrative panels for staff, streamlined digital patient registration, and digital prescription generation.

🚀 Access and Setup

This system is fully documented and can be viewed or installed locally for evaluation.
